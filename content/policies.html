	<h2>Course Policies</h2>

    The official syllabus can be found <a href="../syllabus.pdf">here</a>.  What follows is a summary and some elaboration.

    <h3>Grading</h3>

    The course grade will be apportioned as follows:
    <blockquote>
    	<table cellspacing=0>
    		<tr><td>Homework       <td width=25px></td><td><b>50%</b> </td></tr>
     		<tr><td>Midterm exam        <td></td><td><b>15%</b> </td> </tr>
    		<tr><td>Final exam        <td></td><td><b>35%</b> </td> </tr>
    	</table>
    </blockquote>


    <h3>Homework</h3>

    <ul>
    	<li> All homeworks are due <b> at the beginning </b> of class via Gradescope. </li>
    	<li> You are allowed a total of 120 late hours (equivalent to 5 late days) throughout the semester.  </li>

    	<li> You are allowed to work in groups of up to 3, and this is strongly encouraged.  If you do work in a group, please write the names of your group members on the top of the first page of your homework.</li>

    	<li> On all assignments each person should hand-in their own writeup.  That is, collaboration should be limited to talking about the problems, so that your writeup is written entirely by you and not copied from your partner.  In addition, list all members of your group.</li>

    	<li> All homeworks solutions must be typeset (preferably with LaTeX).

    	</ul>

    	<h3>Policies</h3>

    	<h4>Lateness and Absence</h4>


    	Make-ups for the midterm and final must be arranged at least one week
    	in advance, barring extreme situations.
    	Make sure to document any health problems you might have.


    	<h4>Academic Integrity</h4>

    	Students are expected to adhere to the <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/academic-integrity-code/">Department of Computer Science Academic Integrity Code</a>.  In particular, copying from the Internet or from each other is considered cheating.  You are not allowed to LLMs like ChatGPT, or other resources on the internet such as "backtest" websites, Chegg, Course Hero, etc.  

    	<h3>Necessary Mathematical Background</h3>
    	The mathematical content necessary for this course can mostly be found in the CLRS appendices and Chapter 3.  More important than specific mathematical knowledge, though, is <i>mathematical maturity</i>.  You should know what a rigorous mathematical proof is and how to write one, including common techniques such as induction.  If you are unsure as to whether or not your background is adequate, speak to the instructor as soon as possible.

    	<hr>
    	Finally, feel free to contact the instructor to clarify
    	these policies.  <br /> <br />
